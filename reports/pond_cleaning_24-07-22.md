## Details of activities carried out:

As per the reference cited by the Water Resource Department, youth energy
and enthusiasm is to be properly utilized for the restoration and conservation of
water bodies. In this regard, cadets of the NCC Army Wing of Anna University
conducted a pond cleaning activity on 24th July 2022 from 06:30 a.m. to 07:30 a.m.  
Gloves were distributed, and nearly 2 kilograms of non-biodegradable wastes
as well as the water hyacinth near the pond were collected and discarded by the
cadets. This activity was conducted as an initiative to create public awareness
about keeping the surroundings of the pond neat and clean. Safety measures were
